# Data Structures Implementation in C++
This repository contains implementations of data structures in C++ for performing various operations and data manipulations efficiently. Below is the folder structure and the implemented structures:

## Implemented Structures
Folder "taller1": Implementation of the List data structure.

Folder "taller2": Implementation of the Set data structure.

Folder "taller3": Implementation of the Trie data structure.

## Description of the Structures
1. List

The List data structure is an ordered collection of elements where operations like insertion, deletion, and access to elements can be efficiently performed. The implementation provided in the "taller1" folder allows working with linked lists, offering methods to add elements to the beginning or end of the list, delete elements, search for elements, and obtain information about the size of the list.

2. Set
   
The Set data structure is a collection of unique elements without a specific order. The implementation provided in the "taller2" folder allows working with sets using a hash table-based structure, enabling efficient search and ensuring the uniqueness of elements. Operations like adding elements to the set, deleting elements, checking the membership of an element, and obtaining the size of the set can be performed.

3. Trie
   
The Trie, also known as a prefix tree, is an efficient data structure for storing and searching strings. The implementation provided in the "taller3" folder allows working with Tries, offering methods to insert words, search for complete words or by prefix, delete words, and obtain information about the number of stored words.

## How to Use the Implementations
Each folder contains the source files of the respective implementation of the data structure. You can copy the relevant files into your C++ project and use the provided functions and methods to work with the corresponding data structures.

Remember to include the appropriate header files in your source files to use the data structure implementations.
