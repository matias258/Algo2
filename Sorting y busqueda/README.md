# Search Algorithms in C++
This repository contains implementations of various search algorithms in the C++ language. <br>
These algorithms were learned and developed as part of my studies in college. <br>

## Searching Algorithms
1. Linear Search <br>
2. Binary Search<br>

## Sorting Algorithms
1. Merge Sort <br>
2. Heap Sort <br>
3. Bubble Sort <br>
4. Insertion Sort <br>
5. Selection Sort <br>
6. Counting Sort <br>

## Requirements
To compile and run these algorithms, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. <br>
It is recommended to use GCC or Clang.<br>
